This is a project I grabbed of the internet that I'm going to be editing to make it better!

The original project is located here : https://microcontrollerslab.com/micropython-openweathermap-api-esp32-esp8266-sensorless-weather-station

I  just copied and pasted it onto here and I am going to make it better and add some quality of life features so if you want to check this out download it! If you can think you can make this code even better, do it! Submit a pull request or something, just make it better!
